I enjoy creating dynamic applications that can scale as needed using cloud deployment technologies like heroku for api and database hosting. 
Initially started programming in C++ building small desktop applications. 
Now days I enjoy building web based applications in javascript. 
Javascript applications can work seamlessly across many devices, they can easilly be built to run natively across desktop / web / mobile environments. 
Suffice to say that I now use a more modern stack make use of a modern web development stack built primarilly with nodejs. The express library for managing api requests and connecting to other server side services. My database of choice is mysql databases with a focus in postgresql. 
Currently delving more into the ideas of design patterns and data structures, including more cloud services like AWS S3, lambda functions and EC2 instances. 
These technologies have made my experience building dynamic web applications so enjoyable, everyday I wake up excited to be able to develop in todays time.
