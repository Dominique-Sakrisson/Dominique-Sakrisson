I initially got into coding because of the money. I dreamed of making a big pile of money by sitting at a computer and creating something from nothing. It was after I started plugging myself into working in collaborative environments that I picked up a true desire to be a developer for the sake of being a developer. I've enjoyed nothing more than developing projects in collaboration with others. Things that resonate with me the most are implementing algorithms that take advantage of modern libraries and frameworks. The majority of my experience has been in the ES6 version of javascript.
