I initially got into coding because of the money, I dreamed of making a big pile of money to sit at a computer and create something from nothing. It was after I started plugging myself into working in collaborative environments that I picked up the essence of something else something that wasn't just greed, I found a calling. I've enjoyed nothing more than dedicating my skills to developing a project with others.
When I sit down to code everything else seems to fade away and it becomes all about the problem scope at hand. Things like implementing an algorithm or figuring out how to use a new library for your specific problem are some areas that really resonate with me. In a more altruistic sense, when working as part of a team you get to experience something unlike most other things. You connect with your team in a way that you can feel the other growing. When one of their breakthroughs sparks understanding for yourself you gain knowledge which wouldn't be possible if you were working alone and vise versa. It's truly an experience that has brought much joy to my life and I would encourage anybody who hasn't coded with others to do so with haste.
