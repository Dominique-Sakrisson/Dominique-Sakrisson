 ### I always thought technology was a cool concept. I grew up with star wars and Halo which got me started on sort of a nerdy path. I skateboarded often growing up which involved filming videos and editing videos, thats where I started getting into computers. Video editing software was a big part of being able to make a good video, and those programs were pretty robust. I began to wonder just how did it all work whiched made me decided to take a class in html and web development freshman year of highschool. Fast forward now days I'm not making videos quite so much as I'm writting code. I like a modern web development stack consisting of nodejs/ express, cloud services like amazon s3, for non cloud based relational databases I lean to writting them in postgres. I often will make use of libraries through importing their npm packages in the terminal. Working with other developers and coming up with creative solutions are my favorite aspects of being a developer.
### Actively looking for a new role in software development.
