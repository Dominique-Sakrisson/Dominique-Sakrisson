### or 'cruising around in my 6-4',  üèé


I initially got into coding because of the money. I dreamed of making a big pile of money by sitting at a computer and creating something from nothing. It was after I started plugging myself into working in collaborative environments that I picked up a true desire to be a developer for the sake of being a developer. I've enjoyed nothing more than developing projects in collaboration with others. Things that resonate with me the most are implementing algorithms that take advantage of modern libraries and frameworks. The majority of my experience has been in the ES6 version of javascript. 


 ### I always thought technology was a cool concept. I grew up with star wars and Halo which got me started on sort of a nerdy path. I skateboarded often growing up which involved filming videos and editing videos, thats where I started getting into computers. Video editing software was a big part of being able to make a good video, and those programs were pretty robust. I began to wonder just how did it all work whiched made me decided to take a class in html and web development freshman year of highschool. Fast forward now days I'm not making videos quite so much as I'm writting code. I like a modern web development stack consisting of nodejs/ express, cloud services like amazon s3, for non cloud based relational databases I lean to writting them in postgres. I often will make use of libraries through importing their npm packages in the terminal.
### Actively looking for a new role in software development.
